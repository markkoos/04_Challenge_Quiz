# 04_Challenge_Quiz

## This application shows my ability to use Javascript WebAPIs to create a timed coding quiz.

Includes rules of the quiz, where you have 45 seconds to answer 6 multiple choice questions.

Every incorrect answer will result in a penalty of 5 seconds to your time remaining. Your final score will be how much time you have left when the quiz is completed.

You can also submit text to record your initials and save your final score to be viewed using the "View Scores" button.

All of this was done using many variables that targeted HTML elements and created new ones to append for certain scenarios of the quiz. Individual event listeners were given to button created in the quiz and assigned time penalty functions and additional styling for incorrect choices once selected. The scores and inputted initials were sent to the local storage and are later call upon when the "View Scores" button is pressed.
